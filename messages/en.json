My preference is Backend but I also have extensive knowledge of Frontend with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I use libraries such as React and Nexjs, knowing the advantages of each of them, and the NPM package manager. I am currently developing monolithic applications using the Rest API, using the Spring Java framework as a backend (17) and consuming said backend with Nextjs 14."
